# Qbronze-notes-and-exercises

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey through **QBronze**, an introductory quantum computing workshop organized by [QWorld](https://qworld.net).

It serves as a **living portfolio** of my progress, combining the notes I took from each leacture, solved exercises, practice problems, and even some small projects.

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters (to me)
I know quantum computing is still an emerging field. While some people believe we won't see practical applications for at least another decade, that is exactly what excites me the most: having the opportunity to be a pioneer in what could become one of the most significant technological advancements of the century. 

I believe that the ability of learning independently and document one's journey is timeless. My hope is that, in 10 years, I can return to this repository and see how much everything has changed.
